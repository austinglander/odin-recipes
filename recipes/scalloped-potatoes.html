        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            These fancy scalloped potatoes are a dish in which potato slices are layered around a 
            baking dish to create a beautiful crust for a rosemary potato filling.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>2 close garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 1/2 pound red potatoes</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
                Coat an 8-inch baking dish cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>Mix Parmesan cheese, rosemary, and garlic together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>
                Slice 3 or 4 potatoes using a mandolin on the thinnest setting. 
                Slice remaining potatoes using a slightly thicker setting on the mandolin.
            </li>
            <li>
                Line the bottom of the prepared baking dish with thin potato slices, 
                overlapping them to create a layer that is 2 to 3 slices deep. 
                Stand remaining thin slices along the sides of the baking dish so that half an 
                inch sticks over the rim, overlapping them to create a layer 
                that is 4 slices deep.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread 1/3 of the thicker potato slices in the baking dish. 
                Sprinkle 1/3 of the Parmesan cheese mixture on top. Repeat once more. 
                Arrange remaining potato slices in the baking dish. 
                Reserve 1/3 of the Parmesan cheese mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; whisk in flour. Pour in milk; 
                cook, occasionally stirring, until sauce thickens, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shift potato slices in a few places with a knife to create wells for the 
                sauce to flow through. Pour sauce evenly over potato slices in the baking dish. 
                Sprinkle remaining 1/3 of the Parmesan cheese mixture on top. 
                Brush potato edges sticking out of the baking dish with olive oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are soft and edges are crusted, 
                1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
