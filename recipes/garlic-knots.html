    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        They're unbelievably flaky, buttery, fluffy and they just melt in your mouth. 
        They were so good that after devouring 4 of these in less than 5 minutes, 
        I had to tell Jason to hide them somewhere in the house so I wouldn't eat 
        the entire batch!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> unsalted butter, <em>melted</em></li>
        <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> freshly grated Parmesan</li>
        <li><strong>3/4 teaspoon</strong> garlic powder</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 teaspoon</strong> dried oregano</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 teaspoon</strong> dried parsley flakes</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 teaspoon</strong> salt</li>
        <li><strong>1 (16-ounce) tube</strong> refrigerated buttermilk biscuits</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat with nonstick spray.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together butter, Parmesan, garlic powder, oregano, parsley and salt; set aside.</li>
        <li>Halve each of the 8 biscuits, making 16 pieces. Roll each piece into a 5-inch rope, about 1/2-inch thick, and tie into a knot, tucking the ends.</li>
        <li>Place knots onto the prepared baking sheet and brush each knot with half of the butter mixture. Place into oven and bake until golden brown, about 8-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, brushed with remaining butter mixture.</li>
    </ol>
